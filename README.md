# Diablo 2: Resurrected Skill Cooldown Overlay

This app is not a mod. it is a standalone workaround and non-intrusive solution to display Diablo 2 skill cooldowns for different skills.
The main principe of the app is to track key and button presses on OS level and display predefined skill CDs.

The main reason I've come up to this solution is the inablity to track duration of Druids Werewolf form skill which resulted in many shameful deaths. Moreover it can be used for virtually any skill wich has duration attribute. Well... You can actually use it to track any keys and buttons combinations for any purpose you can come up with. 

## Features
* 100% legit as it don't read or write game memory
* Support any Diablo2 game version

## Logic
* You can add as many skill trackers as you like
* Each skill has several options available for setup
  * Duration - sets skill duration in seconds (you can find it inside the skill tooltip in game)
  * Select skill key - optional key which is used to select the skill before usage as you often use F1-F8 keys for this.
  * Use skill key - actual key or button which is used to fire the skill
  * When select + use keys are specified the app will track this key sequnce and fire skill cd overlay once it is found. If you have only use key specified skill overlay will fire once the key is pressed right away.
* You can set overlay position using the EYE button. Slider in the main window is used to change overlay size.
* Once everything is set up click the PLAY button fo tracker to start tracking the key and button presses.

PS: You can add your own images to ./Images/Skills folder
